# Slider Project - Refactoring

## About the project:
The aim of this project was to rebuild slider, which has been created by another developer by using new JavaScript features (ECMAscript 2015) such as:
-	arrow function,
-	destructuring,
-	the spread operator,
-   others

and creating a slider as a class. The class was later imported to the main file (script.js)
